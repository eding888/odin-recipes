    <p>Spaghetti and Meatballs is a recipe that originates from Italy (or so we're told). It is theorized that this dish originates from an otherworldy planet like Mars, but I digress.</p>
    <p>Let's find out how to make this delicious noodle dish.</p>

    <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A good bit of spaghetti (depending on how hungry you are)</li>
        <li>A jar of your favorite Italian tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Some of those pre-cooked meatballs from Costco (who has the time to make meatballs from scratch..)</li>
        <li>Cheese of the parmesean variety</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Fill up a pot with water.</li>
        <li>Put the water on the stove. Turn on said stove.</li>
        <li>Is the water boiling? Good. Add the spaghetti into to pot.</li>
        <li>Wait until your spaghetti turns soft. You can then drain the water (or drink it, your call).</li>
        <li>Add tomato sauce and meatballs.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle on some cheese of the parmesean.</li>
    </ol>
